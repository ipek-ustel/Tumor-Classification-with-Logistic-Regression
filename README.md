This project is a practical implementation developed as part of the Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification certification from Coursera. It demonstrates the application of supervised learning algorithms to real-world healthcare data.

**Technical Highlights**

Model: Implemented a Logistic Regression classifier to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors.

Features: Analyzed key geometric cell properties such as radius_mean, perimeter_mean, and concavity_mean.

Workflow: Leveraged Pandas for data ingestion and Scikit-learn for model training and inference.
